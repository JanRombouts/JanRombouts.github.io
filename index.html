<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I am a researcher, currently working on the interface between mathematics, physics and biology. I studied mathematics and complex systems science. During my PhD I looked at the modeling of cell cycle oscillations. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at EMBL Heidelberg, where I wonder about how cell-cell interactions lead to patterns and waves. </p>

          <p>On the 8th of July we had lab day at EMBL. With the Erzberger group we prepared some games to illustrate physical principles that underlie biological phenomena. We had a game involving surface tension and floating paperclips, a game with pattern formation and a computer game designed to illustrate what life is like at high and low Reynolds numbers. In this game you play either as a whale or as a bacterium, whose motion is dominated by inertia and friction respectively. The goal was to catch the lab members while avoiding being caught by a swimming Osborne Reynolds.</p>

In this paper, which was a collaboration with master student Sarah Verplaetse, we revisited a classical topic in mathematical biology: biological oscillators. </p>
<p>Periodic processes are present in many biological systems such as the circadian clock, the cell cycle or somitogenesis. The periodicity of these processes manifests, among others, in the repeated production and degradation of molecules. The interaction between different proteins that generates these cycles often contains a time-delayed negative feedback loop. Negative feedback can take different forms, and in this paper we compare two ways of implementing it: on the production step or on the degradation step. We show how these mechanisms impose different constraints on the rate constants that allow oscillations, and derive some mathematical results about simple delay equations that describe the system. </p>
<p>The picture on the left shows spirals in the complex plane, which we use to study the existence of oscillations in systems with a distributed delay. </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>In a new preprint with the Gelens lab, we go back to the basics and study what are arguably some of the most elementary models for biological oscillators. Periodic phenomena lie at the basis of many important processes - think of the circadian clock or the cell division cycle. Many of these oscillators are generated by a time-delayed negative feedback loop. In the paper, we perform a mathematical analysis of simple delay equations that implement two ways in which the feedback may act: on a production step or on a degradation step. We use classic techniques to study the linear stability of these delay equations, and extract interesting mathematical results and some biological principles. The work was done together with Sarah Verplaetse, who did her Master's thesis work at KU Leuven on this topic.</p>

          <p>In February 2019 I attended the Winter Workshop on Complex Systems in Poland. Together with several others I worked on a project in which we studied whether the spreading of delays through a railway network can be described by a model inspired by diffusion on networks. We applied our modeling approach to the Belgian railways. Now, the paper in which we describe our findings is <a href="https://epjds.epj.org/articles/epjdata/abs/2022/01/13688_2022_Article_359/13688_2022_Article_359.html">published in EPJ Data Science</a>.
