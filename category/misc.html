<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I am a researcher, currently working on the interface between mathematics, physics and biology. I studied mathematics and complex systems science. During my PhD I looked at the modeling of cell cycle oscillations. Currently I am a postdoctoral fellow at EMBL Heidelberg, where I wonder about how cell-cell interactions lead to patterns and waves. </p>

          <p>Together with the Young Marsilius Fellows of the <a href="https://www.marsilius-kolleg.uni-heidelberg.de/en">Marsilius Kolleg</a> of Heidelberg University, we organized an event with discussions, talks, games and an exhibition with posters from our 'Data is Art' competition. The title was 'From end to Beginning: An Interdisciplinary Adventure'. We talked about our research and how we found unexpected connections between very different fields, we had discussions about the meaning of heritage and opened up the black box of progress in science. </p>
<p>It was a great afternoon and I think the participants enjoyed it a lot. </p>
<p>I contributed a computer game where players have to cooperate and communicate in order to accomplish a common goal (see also <a href="pages/outreach.html">Outreach</a>). </p>

          <p>Some years ago during my PhD work, we came up with a new method of modeling bistable switches, based on a modification of the Hill function. We used it to model the transitions between different phases of the cell cycle, described in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009008">our 2021 paper</a>. Now, these models have been chosen as one of the three winners of the competition <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/competition/model-of-the-year-2023">'Model of the Year 2023'</a>. This competition is held by the BioModels website, and aims to promote reproducibility and good modeling practice in systems biology. I'm happy to be among the winners! Thanks to Jolan and Lendert for working together on the paper.

          <p>On the 8th of July we had lab day at EMBL. With the Erzberger group we prepared some games to illustrate physical principles that underlie biological phenomena. We had a game involving surface tension and floating paperclips, a game with pattern formation and a computer game designed to illustrate what life is like at high and low Reynolds numbers. In this game you play either as a whale or as a bacterium, whose motion is dominated by inertia and friction respectively. The goal was to catch the lab members while avoiding being caught by a swimming Osborne Reynolds.</p>

In this paper, which was a collaboration with master student Sarah Verplaetse, we revisited a classical topic in mathematical biology: biological oscillators. </p>
<p>Periodic processes are present in many biological systems such as the circadian clock, the cell cycle or somitogenesis. The periodicity of these processes manifests, among others, in the repeated production and degradation of molecules. The interaction between different proteins that generates these cycles often contains a time-delayed negative feedback loop. Negative feedback can take different forms, and in this paper we compare two ways of implementing it: on the production step or on the degradation step. We show how these mechanisms impose different constraints on the rate constants that allow oscillations, and derive some mathematical results about simple delay equations that describe the system. </p>
<p>The picture on the left shows spirals in the complex plane, which we use to study the existence of oscillations in systems with a distributed delay. </p>

First, in July, there is the EMBL Symposium on <a href="https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/ees23-07/">Theory and Concepts in Biology</a> here in Heidelberg. 
In August I'll cross the channel and participate in the workshop on <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/mmvw02/">Collective Behaviour</a> at the INI in Cambridge. If you are at one of these events and want to have a chat, feel free to get in touch!</p>

        </h4>
        <div class="content">
          <p>In a new preprint with the Gelens lab, we go back to the basics and study what are arguably some of the most elementary models for biological oscillators. Periodic phenomena lie at the basis of many important processes - think of the circadian clock or the cell division cycle. Many of these oscillators are generated by a time-delayed negative feedback loop. In the paper, we perform a mathematical analysis of simple delay equations that implement two ways in which the feedback may act: on a production step or on a degradation step. We use classic techniques to study the linear stability of these delay equations, and extract interesting mathematical results and some biological principles. The work was done together with Sarah Verplaetse, who did her Master's thesis work at KU Leuven on this topic.</p>
