      <h3>Short bio</h3>
<p>I originally studied mathematics at KU Leuven, Belgium, with a main focus on pure mathematics. I wrote my Master's thesis in the analysis section, on the topic of orthogonal polynomials and their relation to quantum random walks. After my studies in mathematics I decided that I wanted to learn more about real-world applications. I did an additional Master's degree in Complex Systems Science. This was a European Erasmus Mundus program, which led me to France (Ecole Polytechnique) and the UK (University of Warwick). Here I encountered many different facets of complex systems and mathematical modeling. As part of this Master's program I worked on projects in epidemiology, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-22-275-2015">climate dynamics</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/19M129070X">mathematical biology</a>. This study program has been very influential for me; many of the topics I currently work I first encountered during these two years. </p>
<p>After my studies I taught mathematics for one year, at university and in secondary school. This was a great experience, but after this year I decided that research was what I wanted to do and at the end of 2016 I started my PhD in the <a href="https://www.gelenslab.org">group of Lendert Gelens</a>. I worked on mathematical models of the cell division cycle and defended in May 2021. From January 2022 until December 2024,I worked as an EIPOD postdoctoral fellow in the groups of <a href="https://www.embl.org/groups/erzberger">Anna Erzberger's</a> and <a href="https://www.embl.org/groups/aulehla">Alexander Aulehla's</a> at EMBL in Heidelberg. From October 2023 to 2024, I was also one of the <a href="https://www.marsilius-kolleg.uni-heidelberg.de/YoungMarsiliusFellows_en.html">Young Marsilius Fellows</a> at the Marsilius Kolleg of Heidelberg University. </p>
<p>In January 2025 I started as an FNRS-funded postdoc with Geneviève Dupont in the <a href="https://utc.ulb.be/home.html">Unit of Theoretical Chronobiology</a> at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). </p>
<p>Besides research, I enjoy thinking about communicating scientific ideas to a wider audience. I play the piano and enjoy video games as well as running. </p>
